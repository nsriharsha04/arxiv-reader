# arxiv-reader
Python code to read papers from arxiv and provide analytics
This project will access Arxiv metadata on papers from 2017 to 2021 for certain categories.

### Notebook1
• Access Arxiv and get metadata (title, authors, summary etc) of all the papers in the primary categories of:
– AI
– ML
– Computational complexity
– Hardware architecture
• Save the data of any format in multiple files.

### Notebook2
• Using the stored data from the last task, create a dataframe for each primary category (ML, AI, computational complexity, Hardware architecture), the various fields of the metadata will become columns (title, authors, summary, etc)
• Display first 5 lines of each primary category

### Notebook3
• For each of the four primary categories considered, draw a pie chart with slices (%age) for
➢single author papers ➢two authors papers ➢3-4 authors papers ➢More than four authors.

### Notebook4
• Plot a bar graph
• On the X axis -> years
• On the Y axis -> number of papers uploaded
• Bars grouped by category
